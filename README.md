# Lab 2: Data Classification and Chatbots 
### Part 1 
This script defines a function that classifies temperature via user input. Using `if/elif/else` I classified the temperature into four different categories (hot, warm, cool, and cold). 
### Part 2
This script created a chatbot, called through a function named `computer`. This function interacts with the user two times using `input`. The first time is to ask a name, and the function uses `if/elif/else` to determine which greeting the user receives. Then, the bot asks for the user's age, and another conditional statement is used to determine whether the user is 'old' or 'young'. 
#### Issues? 
The only roadblock I came across during this lab was that originally, I was using two functions for the chatbot, but I decided to simplify the code and use one function for both. I rememebered I could add two variables to the function definition 
```python
def function(name,age):
```
and this really helped me simplify my code!
